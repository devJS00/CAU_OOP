- Summary of our project
 The goal of this project is to make a program for implementing the schedule management system, especially for students. As the program consists of managing schedules for assignments and exams, its main target is students though anyone could use this if they want. On the program, the user simply could make an input about the information on the assignment or the exam, then look at the overview of its own schedule on the screen.
The core function of the project is to click a date on the calendar to see what the schedule is on that date, and to see the schedule sorted by D-Day, Priority, and Difficulty in the assignment and exam lists.

PS. There are some initial values in SaveInfos_Data.json. So if you want to test this program with already inserted value, copy this file's contents and paste it into SaveInfos_Empty.json
